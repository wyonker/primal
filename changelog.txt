* Everything

This is a major update.  I have probably broken the install on CentOS/RHEL 7
in an effort to update for RHEL 8.  I still need to test on Alma Linux 9 as
that will be my CentOS replacement platform.

Most everything works now excep the -ac option in the storescp.  The
tcpwrapper lib has gone away and the DCMTK team has opted to use the
hosts.deny file instead.
